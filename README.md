A hospital requires a system to manage doctors and the patients under their care. Each doctor can manage multiple patients, while each patient is assigned to only one primary doctor. The system must allow doctors to perform various tasks, including scheduling appointments, diagnosing medical conditions, and prescribing treatments to their patients.

For instance, doctors can use the system to schedule appointments on specific dates for each patient and add new diagnoses to a patient's medical history. Additionally, doctors can assign treatments to patients based on their diagnosis and discharge patients once they have recovered.

On the patientâ€™s side, the system will allow patients to view their upcoming appointments, check if they have any ongoing treatments, and track their medical history, which is updated whenever the doctor provides a diagnosis. The system ensures that doctors can efficiently manage multiple patients while providing individualized care and keeping all medical records up-to-date.
